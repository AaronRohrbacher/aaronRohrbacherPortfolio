# Production deployment prohibition

NEVER deploy to production. The user explicitly prohibits this, including when
asked to implement, fix, or "set up" something. Do not infer deployment permission.
Do not run production deployment scripts, `sst deploy --stage production`, or
equivalent commands, trigger production deployment workflows, or delegate them.
Do not make direct production infrastructure changes as a deployment workaround.
Keep implementation and verification local. Production deployment is left to the user.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
