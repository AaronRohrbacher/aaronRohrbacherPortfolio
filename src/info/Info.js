    bio: "Hi there! My name is Aaron Rohrbacher, and I'm a senior-level full stack software engineer. I'm currently working for a company named Sparq, where I drive our clients' most critical infrastructure decision making. Using the aforementioned decisions, I architect comprehensive cloud infrastructure, and lead my teams as a player-coach in building web apps that our clients fall in love with. I thrive on doing the right thing, and those who do the same! When I'm not behind a computer keyboard, I'm behind a musical one, or playing my saxophone.",
